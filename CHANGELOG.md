# Changelog

All notable changes to TablePro will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Refactored menu and toolbar commands from NotificationCenter to `@FocusedObject` pattern — menu commands and toolbar buttons now call `MainContentCommandActions` methods directly instead of posting global notifications, with context-aware routing for structure view operations
- Redesigned connection form with tab-based layout (General / SSH Tunnel / SSL/TLS / Advanced), replacing the single-scroll layout
- Revamped connection form UI to use native macOS grouped form style (`Form`/`.formStyle(.grouped)`) with `LabeledContent` for automatic label-value alignment and `Section` headers — replacing the previous hand-rolled `VStack` layout with custom `FormField` component
- Removed unused `FormField` component and helper methods (`iconForType`, `colorForType`)
- SQLite connections now only show General and Advanced tabs (SSH/SSL hidden)
- Added async/await wrapper methods to `QueryHistoryStorage` — existing completion-handler API preserved for compatibility, new `async` overloads use `withCheckedContinuation` for modern Swift concurrency callers

### Fixed
- Fixed retain cycle in `UpdaterBridge` — `.assign(to:on:self)` retains self strongly; replaced with `.sink` using `[weak self]`
- Fixed leaked NotificationCenter observer in `SQLEditorCoordinator` — observer token is now stored and removed in `destroy()`
- Eliminated tab switching delay — replaced view teardown/recreation with `ZStack`+`ForEach` to keep NSViews alive, moved tab persistence I/O to background threads, skipped unnecessary change-tracking deep copies, and coalesced redundant inspector/sidebar updates during tab switch
- Reduced tab-switch CPU spikes from 40-60% to ~10-20% by eliminating redundant `reloadData()` calls: `configureForTable` no longer triggers a reload during tab switch (single controlled bump instead of 2-3), `onChange(of: resultColumns)` is suppressed while the switch is in progress, and `DataGridView.updateNSView` skips all heavy work when the data identity hasn't changed
- Table open now shows data instantly — split `executeQueryInternal` into two phases: rows display immediately after SELECT completes, metadata (columns, FKs, enums, row count) loads in the background without blocking the grid
- Eliminated 20-80ms overhead when clicking an already-open table in the sidebar — `openTableTab` short-circuits immediately, and `TableProTabSmart` no longer fires `@Published` when the selected tab hasn't changed
- Keychain `SecItemAdd` return values are now checked and logged — previously, failed writes (e.g. `errSecDuplicateItem`, `errSecInteractionNotAllowed`) were silently discarded, risking password loss
- Added `kSecAttrService` to all Keychain queries across `ConnectionStorage`, `LicenseStorage`, and `AIKeyStorage` — items now have a proper service identifier, preventing potential collisions with other apps
- Ensured proper cleanup for `@State` reference type tokens — tracked untracked `Task` instances in `ImportDialog` (file selection), `AIProviderEditorSheet` (model fetching, connection test), and added `onDisappear` cancellation to prevent leaked work after view dismissal
- Replaced `.onAppear` with `.task` for I/O operations in `ConnectionTagEditor` — uses SwiftUI-idiomatic lifecycle-tied loading instead of `onAppear` which can re-fire on navigation

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Inline AI suggestions (ghost text) in the SQL editor — auto-triggers on typing pause, Tab to accept, Escape to dismiss
- Schema-aware inline suggestions — AI now uses actual table/column names from the connected database (cached with 30s TTL, respects `includeSchema` and `maxSchemaTables` settings)
- AI feature highlight row on onboarding features page

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-19

### Changed
- AI chat panel — native macOS inspector styling: removed iOS-style chat bubbles, flattened message layout with role headers and compact spacing, reduced heading sizes for narrow sidebar, inline typing indicator without pill background
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** migrated 5 NSPopover controllers (Enum, Set, TypePicker, JSONEditor, ForeignKey) to SwiftUI content views with a shared `PopoverPresenter` utility — eliminates manual `NSEvent` monitors, `NSPopoverDelegate`, and singleton patterns
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced `KeyEventHandler` NSViewRepresentable with native `.onKeyPress()` modifiers (macOS 14+) in DatabaseSwitcherSheet and WelcomeWindowView
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced AppKit history panel (5 files: `HistoryPanelController`, `HistoryListViewController`, `QueryPreviewViewController`, `HistoryTableView`, `HistoryRowView`) with single pure SwiftUI `HistoryPanelView` using `HSplitView`, `List` with selection, context menus, and swipe-to-delete
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced `ExportTableOutlineView` (NSOutlineView, 757 lines across 2 files) with SwiftUI `ExportTableTreeView` using `List`, `DisclosureGroup`, and tristate checkboxes (~146 lines)
- **Design tokens:** replaced hardcoded `Color.secondary.opacity(0.6)` with system `Color(nsColor: .tertiaryLabelColor)` in `DesignConstants` and `ToolbarDesignTokens` for proper semantic color

### Added
- AI chat panel shows "Set Up AI Provider" empty state when no AI provider is configured, with a button to open Settings
- AI chat panel — right-side panel for AI-assisted SQL queries with multi-provider support (Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, custom endpoints)
- AI provider settings — configure multiple AI providers in Settings > AI with API key management (Keychain), endpoint configuration, model selection, and connection testing
- AI feature routing — map AI features (Chat, Explain Query, Fix Error, Inline Suggestions) to specific providers and models
- AI schema context — automatically includes database schema, current query, and query results in AI conversations for context-aware assistance
- AI chat code blocks — SQL code blocks in AI responses include Copy and Insert to Editor buttons
- AI chat markdown rendering — replaced custom per-line AttributedString parsing with MarkdownUI library for full CommonMark + GitHub Flavored Markdown support (proper lists, tables, blockquotes, headers, strikethrough)
- Per-connection AI policy — control AI access per connection (Always Allow, Ask Each Time, Never) in the connection form
- Toggle AI Chat keyboard shortcut (`⌘⇧L`) and toolbar button
- Tab reuse setting — opt-in option in Settings > Tabs to reuse clean table tabs when clicking a new table in the sidebar (off by default)
- Structure view: full undo/redo support (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z) for all column, index, and foreign key operations
- Structure view: database-specific type picker popover for the Type column — searchable, grouped by category (Numeric, String, Date & Time, Binary, Other), supports freeform input for parametric types like `VARCHAR(255)`
- Structure view: YES/NO dropdown menu for Nullable, Auto Inc, and Unique columns (replaces freeform text input)
- Structure view: "Don't show again" toggle in SQL preview sheet now correctly skips the review step on future saves
- SQL autocomplete: new clause types — RETURNING, UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT, OVER/PARTITION BY, USING, DROP/CREATE INDEX/VIEW
- SQL autocomplete: smart clause transition suggestions (e.g., WHERE after FROM, HAVING after GROUP BY, LIMIT after ORDER BY)
- SQL autocomplete: qualified column suggestions (`table.column`) in JOIN ON clauses and `table.*` in SELECT
- SQL autocomplete: compound keyword suggestions — `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, `NULLS FIRST`, `NULLS LAST`, `ON CONFLICT`, `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`
- SQL autocomplete: richer column metadata in suggestions (primary key, nullability, default value, comment)
- SQL autocomplete: keyword documentation in completion popover
- SQL autocomplete: expanded keyword and function coverage — window functions, PostgreSQL/MySQL-specific, transaction, DCL, aggregate, datetime, string, numeric, JSON
- SQL autocomplete: context-aware suggestions for ALTER TABLE, INSERT INTO, CREATE TABLE, and COUNT(*)
- SQL autocomplete: improved fuzzy match scoring — prefix and contains matches rank above fuzzy-only matches
- Keyboard shortcut customization in Settings > Keyboard — rebind any menu shortcut via press-to-record UI, with conflict detection and "Reset to Defaults" support
- Keyboard shortcut for Switch Connection (`⌘⌥C`) — quickly open the connection switcher popover from the menu or keyboard

### Changed

- **Layout architecture:** replaced `SplitViewMinWidthEnforcer` NSViewRepresentable hack with proper AppDelegate-based inspector split view configuration — eliminates KVO observation, 300ms sleep, and recursive view tree traversal
- **Inspector data flow:** replaced manual snapshot syncing (`syncRightPanelSnapshotData()` + 5 `onChange` handlers) with `InspectorContext` value type passed directly through the view hierarchy via `@Binding`
- **Right panel state:** `RightPanelState` no longer holds snapshot copies of coordinator data or a weak coordinator reference — it now only manages panel visibility, tab state, and owned objects
- **AI chat panel:** receives `currentQuery: String?` parameter instead of a `MainContentCoordinator` reference — better separation of concerns
- **Sidebar save:** replaced `.saveSidebarChanges` notification with direct closure (`RightPanelState.onSave`) set by the notification handler
- Structure tab grid columns now auto-size to fit content on data load
- Structure view column headers and status messages are now localized
- SQL autocomplete: 50ms debounce for completion triggers to reduce unnecessary work
- SQL autocomplete: fuzzy matching rewritten for O(1) character access performance

### Fixed

- **Structure view:** undo/redo (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z) now works for all schema editing operations — previously non-functional
- **Structure view:** undo-delete no longer duplicates existing rows in the grid
- **Structure view:** deleting a new (unsaved) item then undoing correctly re-adds it
- **Structure view:** save button now disabled when validation errors exist (empty column names/types)
- **Structure view:** validation now rejects indexes and foreign keys referencing columns pending deletion
- **Structure view:** multi-column foreign keys are correctly preserved instead of being truncated to single-column
- **Structure view:** renaming a MySQL/MariaDB column now uses `CHANGE COLUMN` instead of `MODIFY COLUMN` (which cannot rename)
- **Structure view:** eliminated redundant `discardChanges()` and `loadSchemaForEditing()` calls on save and initial load
- **PostgreSQL:** DDL tab now includes PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and FOREIGN KEY constraints plus standalone indexes
- **PostgreSQL:** primary key columns are now correctly detected and displayed in the structure grid
- **Security:** escape table and database names in all driver schema queries to prevent SQL injection from names containing special characters
- **SQL editor:** undo/redo (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z) now works correctly (was blocked by responder chain selector mismatch)
- **SQL autocomplete:** clause detection now works correctly inside subqueries
- **SQL autocomplete:** block comment detection no longer treats `--` inside `/* */` as a line comment
- **SQL autocomplete:** database-specific type keywords (e.g., PostgreSQL `JSONB`, MySQL `ENUM`) now appear in suggestions
- **SQL autocomplete:** schema suggestions no longer disappear after CREATE TABLE
- **SQL autocomplete:** function completion now inserts `COUNT()` with cursor between parentheses instead of `COUNT(`
- **SQL autocomplete:** RETURNING suggestions now work after INSERT INTO and after closed `VALUES (...)` parentheses
- **SQL autocomplete:** CREATE INDEX ON suggests columns from the referenced table instead of table names
- **SQL autocomplete:** transition keywords (WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY) no longer buried under columns at clause boundaries
- **SQL autocomplete:** schema-qualified names (e.g., `schema.table.column`) handled correctly
- **Data grid:** column order no longer flashes/swaps when sorting (stable identifiers for layout persistence)
- **Data grid:** "Copy Column Name" and "Filter with column" context menu actions no longer copy sort indicators (e.g., "name 1▲")
- **SQL generation:** ALTER TABLE, DDL, and SQL Preview statements now consistently end with a semicolon
- **AI chat:** "Ask Each Time" connection policy now shows a confirmation dialog before sending data to AI — previously silently fell through to "Always Allow"

### Removed

- Deleted unused `StructureTableCoordinator.swift` (~275 lines of dead code)
- Deleted 5 dead NSToolbar files (`ToolbarController`, `ToolbarWindowConfigurator`, `ToolbarItemFactory`, `ToolbarItemIdentifier`, `ToolbarHostingViews`) — never referenced by active code
- Removed `SplitViewMinWidthEnforcer` struct from `ContentView.swift`
- Removed `.saveSidebarChanges` notification definition and subscription

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- SQL Preview button (eye icon) in toolbar to review all pending SQL statements before committing changes (⌘⇧P)
- Multi-column sorting: Shift+click column headers to add columns to the sort list; regular click replaces with single sort. Sort priority indicators (1▲, 2▼) are shown in column headers when multiple columns are sorted
- "Copy with Headers" feature (Shift+Cmd+C) to copy selected rows with column headers as the first TSV line, also available via context menu in the data grid
- Column width persistence within tab session: resized columns retain their width across pagination, sorting, and filtering reloads

- SQL editor horizontal scrolling for long lines without word wrapping
- Scroll-to-match navigation in SQL editor find panel
- GitHub Sponsors funding configuration

### Changed

- Raise minimum macOS version from 13.5 (Ventura) to 14.0 (Sonoma)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- Fix syntax highlighting not applying after paste in SQL editor — defer frame-change notification so the visible range recalculates after layout processes the new text
- Fix data grid not refreshing after inserting a new row by incrementing `reloadVersion` on row insertion

- Language setting in General preferences (System, English, Vietnamese) with full Vietnamese localization (637 strings)
- Connection health monitoring with automatic reconnection for MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL — pings every 30 seconds, retries 3 times with exponential backoff (2s/4s/8s) on failure
- Manual "Reconnect" toolbar button appears when connection is lost or in error state

### Changed

- Migrate `Libs/*.a` static libraries to Git LFS tracking to reduce repository clone size
- Remove stale `.gitignore` entries for architecture-specific MariaDB libraries
- Replace `filter { }.count` with `count(where:)` across 7 files for more efficient collection counting

- Replace `.count > 0` with `!.isEmpty` in documentation example

### Fixed

- Fix launch crash on macOS 13 caused by missing `asyncAndWait` symbol in CodeEditSourceEditor 0.15.2 (API requires macOS 14+); updated dependency to track `main` branch which uses `sync` instead
- Escape single quotes in PostgreSQL `pg_enum` lookup and SQLite `sqlite_master` queries to prevent SQL injection
- ENUM column nullable detection now uses actual schema metadata instead of heuristic rawType check
- PostgreSQL primary key modification now queries the actual constraint name from `pg_constraint` instead of assuming the `{table}_pkey` naming convention, supporting tables with custom constraint names
