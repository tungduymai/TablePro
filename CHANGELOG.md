# Changelog

All notable changes to TablePro will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Deep link support via `tablepro://` URL scheme for opening connections, tables, queries, and importing connections
- "Copy as URL" context menu action on connections to copy connection details as a URL string (e.g., `mysql://user:pass@host/db`)
- Auto-show inspector option: automatically open the right sidebar when selecting a row (Settings > Data Grid)

### Fixed

- "Table not found" error when switching databases within the same connection (Cmd+K) while a table tab is open
- Right sidebar state now persists across native window-tabs instead of resetting to closed

## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- MySQL second tab showing empty rows due to premature coordinator teardown during native macOS tab group merging
- MongoDB tab name showing "MQL Query" instead of collection name when using bracket notation `db["collection"].find()`

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- Environment color indicator: subtle toolbar tint based on connection color for at-a-glance environment identification
- Import database connections from SSH tunnel URLs (e.g., `mysql+ssh://`, `postgresql+ssh://`)
- Connection groups for organizing database connections into folders with colored headers

### Fixed

- Toolbar briefly showing "MySQL" and missing version (e.g., "MongoDB" instead of "MongoDB 8.2.5") when opening a new tab
- Keyboard shortcuts not working (beep sound) after connecting from welcome screen until a second tab is opened
- Toolbar overflow menu showing only one item and missing all other buttons when window is narrow
- AI chat showing "SQL" language label and missing syntax highlighting for MongoDB code blocks

### Changed

- Refactored toolbar to use individual `ToolbarItem` entries with `Label` for native macOS overflow behavior, and moved History/Export/Import to `.secondaryAction` overflow menu
- Redesigned right sidebar detail pane with compact field layout and type-aware editors

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- Support for multiple independent database connections in separate windows with per-window session isolation
- MongoDB database support
- Custom About window with version info and links (Website, GitHub, Documentation)
- Import database connections from URL/connection string (e.g., `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db`)
- Release notes in Sparkle update window

### Fixed

- New row (Cmd+I) and duplicated row not appearing in datagrid until manual refresh
- PostgreSQL SSH tunnel connections failing with "no encryption" due to SSL config not being preserved
- PostgreSQL SSL `sslrootcert` passed unconditionally to libpq, causing certificate verification failure even in `Required` mode

## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Fix app bundle not ad-hoc signed — signing step was unreachable when no dylibs were bundled

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Fix Sparkle auto-update failing with "improperly signed" error — release ZIPs now preserve framework symlinks and include proper ad-hoc code signatures

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Vim keybindings for SQL editor (Normal/Insert/Visual modes, motions, operators, :w/:q commands) with toggle in Editor Settings
- `^` and `_` motions (first non-blank character) in Vim normal, visual, and operator-pending modes
- `:q` command to close current tab in Vim command-line mode
- PostgreSQL schema switching via ⌘K database switcher (browse and switch between schemas like `public`, `auth`, custom schemas)

### Changed

- Convert QueryHistoryStorage and QueryHistoryManager from callback-based async dispatch to native Swift async/await — eliminates double thread hops per history operation
- Consolidate ExportService @Published properties into single state struct — reduces objectWillChange events from 7 per batch to 1
- Consolidate ImportService @Published properties into single state struct — reduces objectWillChange events during SQL import
- Replace DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter chains in AppDelegate startup with structured Task-based retry loops
- Merge 3 identical Combine notification subscriptions in SidebarViewModel into Publishers.Merge3
- Make AIChatStorage encoder/decoder static — shared across all instances instead of duplicated

### Fixed

- Cell edit showing modified background but displaying original value until save (reloadData during active editing ignored by NSTableView, updateNSView blocked by editedRow guard)
- Undo on inserted row cell edit not syncing insertedRowData (stale values after undo)
- Vim Escape key not exiting Insert/Visual mode when autocomplete popup is visible (popup's event monitor consumed the key)
- Copy (Cmd+C) and Cut (Cmd+X) not working in SQL editor — clipboard retained old value due to CodeEditTextView's copy: silently failing
- Vim yank/delete operations not syncing to system clipboard (register only stored text internally)
- Vim word motions (`w`, `b`, `e`) using two-class word boundary detection instead of correct three-class (word chars, punctuation, whitespace)
- Vim visual mode selection now correctly includes cursor character (inclusive selection matching real Vim behavior)
- Arrow keys now work in Vim visual/normal mode (mapped to h/j/k/l instead of bypassing the Vim engine)
- Vim block cursor now follows the moving end of the selection in visual mode instead of staying at the anchor
- Vim visual mode selection highlight now renders visibly (trigger needsDisplay after programmatic selection)
- Fix event monitor leaks in SQL editor — `deinit` now cleans up NSEvent monitors, notification observers, and work items that leaked when CodeEditSourceEditor never called `destroy()`
- Fix unbounded memory growth from NativeTabRegistry holding full QueryTab objects (including RowBuffer references) — registry now stores lightweight TabSnapshot structs
- Fix SortedRowsCache storing full row copies — now stores index permutations only, halving sorted-tab memory
- Fix schema provider memory leak — shared providers are now reference-counted with 5s grace period removal when all windows for a connection close
- Fix duplicate schema fetches in InlineSuggestionManager — now shares the coordinator's SQLSchemaProvider instead of maintaining a separate cache
- Fix background tabs retaining full result data indefinitely — RowBuffer eviction frees memory for inactive tabs (re-fetched on switch back)
- Fix InMemoryRowProvider bulk cache eviction — now uses proximity-based eviction keeping entries near current scroll position
- Fix stale tabRowProviders entries when tab IDs change without count changing
- Fix crash on macOS 14.x caused by `_strchrnul` symbol not found in libpq.5.dylib — switch libpq and OpenSSL from dynamic Homebrew linking to vendored static libraries built with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0
- Fix duplicate tabs and lag when inserting SQL from AI Chat or History panel with multiple window-tabs open — notification handlers now only fire in the key window
- Fix "Run in New Tab" race condition in History panel — replaced fragile two-notification + 100ms delay pattern with a single atomic notification
- Fix MainContentCoordinator deinit Task that may never execute — added explicit teardown() method with didTeardown guard and orphaned schema provider purge
- Fix SQLEditorCoordinator deinit deferring InlineSuggestionManager cleanup to Task — added explicit destroy() lifecycle and didDestroy guard with warning log
- Fix ExportService while-true batch loops not checking Task.isCancelled — cancelled exports now stop promptly instead of running all remaining batches
- Fix DataGridView full column reconfiguration on every resultVersion bump — narrowed rebuild condition to only trigger when transitioning from empty state
- Fix ConnectionHealthMonitor fixed 30s interval that delays failure detection — added checkNow() with wakeUpContinuation for immediate health checks and exponential backoff
- Fix HistoryPanelView and TableStructureView asyncAfter copy-reset timers not cancellable — replaced with cancellable Task pattern
- Fix MainContentView redundant onChange handler causing cascading re-renders on tab/table changes
- Fix DatabaseManager notification observer creating unnecessary Tasks when self is already deallocated — added guard let self before Task creation

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Refactored sidebar table list to MVVM architecture with testable SidebarViewModel
- Extracted TableRow and context menu into separate files (TableRowView.swift, SidebarContextMenu.swift)
- Migrated to native macOS window tabs (`NSWindow` tabbing) — tab bar is now rendered by macOS itself, identical to Finder/Safari/Xcode tabs with automatic dark/light mode support, drag-to-reorder, and "Merge All Windows" for free
- Each tab is a full independent window with its own sidebar, editor, and state — no more shared tab manager or ZStack keep-alive pattern
- New Tab (Cmd+T) creates a native macOS window tab; Close Tab (Cmd+W) closes the native tab
- Tab switching (Cmd+Shift+[/], Cmd+1-9) now uses native macOS tab navigation
- Sidebar table selection is per-window-tab (independent of other tabs)
- Tab persistence now saves/restores combined state from all native window tabs via NativeTabRegistry; restored tabs reopen as individual native window tabs
- Sidebar table click navigates in-place when no unsaved changes; opens new native tab when dirty
- FK navigation follows the same in-place/new-tab behavior based on unsaved changes
- "Show All Tables" now opens metadata query in a new native tab instead of appending to the current window
- Create Table success closes the create-table window and opens the new table in a fresh native tab
- Window title updates dynamically after navigate-in-place (sidebar click, FK navigation)

### Fixed

- Sidebar loses keyboard focus (arrow key navigation) after opening a second table tab
- Sidebar active state flash and loss when clicking a table that opens in a new native window tab — removed the async revert; each window now re-syncs its sidebar via `NSWindow.didBecomeKeyNotification`, and programmatic syncs skip navigation via an early-return guard
- Sidebar loses active state when opening a second table in a new native window tab — `handleTabSelectionChange` now calls `syncSidebarToCurrentTab()` so the new window's empty `localSelectedTables` is seeded from the restored tab
- Sidebar now refreshes immediately after switching databases via Cmd+K — clears `session.tables` during the switch so `SidebarView.onChange` triggers `loadTables()` against the new database without requiring a manual refresh
- Cmd+W in empty state (after all tabs are cleared) now closes the connection window and disconnects, instead of doing nothing
- Fix Cmd+K database switch flooding all windows with error alerts — `.refreshAll` broadcast caused every window to re-execute its table query against the wrong database; now only the current tab re-executes, and only if its table exists in the new database
- Fix clicking a table in the sidebar replacing the current tab instead of opening a new native tab
- Fix clicking a table from a query tab overwriting the SQL editor instead of opening a separate table tab
- Tab persistence no longer overwrites combined state from all windows when a single window saves — uses NativeTabRegistry for combined state
- Query text editing in one window no longer corrupts other windows' persisted tab state
- Fix Cmd+W on any tab disconnecting the session and showing welcome screen — now only disconnects when the last main window is closed
- Fix Cmd+T from empty state creating two native tabs instead of one — now adds a query tab to the current window
- Fix clicking a table in the sidebar from empty state not opening the table — now creates a table tab in the current window
- Fix native tab title showing "SQL Query" instead of the table name when opening a table from empty state
- Fix Cmd+W on the last tab disconnecting the session instead of returning to empty state

### Removed

- Removed broken SidebarFocusRestorer (non-functional NSViewRepresentable focus hack)
- Removed dead code: unused onTablePro callback, single-table toggle methods
- Custom AppKit tab bar (NativeTabBarView) — replaced by native macOS window tab bar
- Removed vestigial multi-tab code: `performDirectTabSwitch`, `skipNextTabChangeOnChange`, `tabPendingChanges`, `tabSelectionCache`, `lastFlushTime`, `filterStateSavedExternally`, `flushSelectionCache`, `duplicateTab`, `togglePin`, `selectTab`, `switchToDatabase` (legacy)

### Performance

- Cache SQLSchemaProvider per connection so new native tabs reuse the already-loaded schema instead of re-fetching tables and columns from the database (saves 500ms-2s per tab)
- Schema loading now runs in background, no longer blocks the data query from starting — table data appears immediately while autocomplete schema loads concurrently
- Remove unconditional 100ms sleep in `waitForConnectionAndExecute` when connection is already established
- Defer `loadTableMetadataIfNeeded` until after the tab's first query completes, avoiding a redundant DB round-trip during tab initialization
- Replace `@ObservedObject dbManager` in ContentView with targeted `@State` + `onReceive` — eliminates O(N) view cascade where every window re-rendered on any DatabaseManager state change
- Remove `@StateObject dbManager` from TableProApp — prevents app-level body re-evaluation on every DatabaseManager publish
- Batch `connectToSession` session mutations into a single `activeSessions` write — reduces 5 separate `objectWillChange` publishes to 1
- Remove redundant `DatabaseManager.updateSession` calls in tab change handlers — NativeTabRegistry already handles persistence, eliminating unnecessary `@Published` cascades
- Add initialization guard to `initializeAndRestoreTabs` preventing duplicate query execution from racing `.task` and `onChange(of: selectedTabId)` paths
- Replace `onChange(of: DatabaseManager.shared.currentSession?.*)` with per-window `onReceive` filtered by connection ID — stops SwiftUI from tracking the global DatabaseManager singleton as a dependency
- Guard health monitor status writes to skip no-op `.connected` → `.connected` transitions — eliminates idle 30-second cascade on all windows
- Extract all menu commands into `AppMenuCommands` struct — `AppState` changes now only re-evaluate menu items, not the Scene body / all WindowGroups
- Add `isContentViewEquivalent(to:)` comparison on `ConnectionSession` — skips `@State` writes when only `tabs`, `selectedTabId`, or `lastActiveAt` changed, preventing O(N) MainContentView.init cascade across windows

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Quick search and filter rows can now be combined — when both are active, their WHERE conditions are joined with AND
- Foreign key columns now show a navigation arrow icon in each cell — click to open the referenced table filtered by the FK value

### Changed

- Metadata queries (columns, FKs, row count) now run on a dedicated parallel connection, eliminating 200-300ms delay for FK arrows and pagination count on initial table load
- Approximate row count from database metadata displays instantly with data; exact count refines silently in the background
- Show warning indicator on filter presets referencing columns not in current table
- Increase filter row height estimate for better accessibility support
- FK navigation now uses dedicated FilterStateManager.setFKFilter API instead of direct property manipulation
- Add syntax highlighting to Import SQL file preview
- XLSX export now enforces the Excel row limit (1,048,576) per sheet and uses autoreleasepool per row to reduce peak memory during large exports
- Multiline cell values now use a scrollable overlay editor instead of the constrained field editor, enabling proper vertical scrolling and line navigation during inline editing
- AnyChangeManager now uses a reference-type box for lazy initialization, avoiding Combine pipeline creation during SwiftUI body evaluation
- DataGridView identity check moved before AppSettingsManager read to skip settings access when nothing has changed
- DataGridView async column width write-back now uses an isWritingColumnLayout guard to prevent two-frame bounce
- Tab switch flushPendingSave debounced to skip redundant saves within 100ms of rapid tab switching
- SQL editor frame-change notification throttled to 50ms to avoid redundant syntax highlight viewport recalculation on every keystroke
- SQL editor text binding sync now uses O(1) NSString length pre-check before O(n) full string equality comparison
- Toolbar executing state now fires a single objectWillChange instead of double-publishing isExecuting and connectionState
- Row provider onChange handlers coalesced into a single trigger to avoid redundant InMemoryRowProvider rebuilds
- SQL import now uses file-size estimation instead of a separate counting pass, eliminating the double-parse overhead for large files
- History cleanup COUNT + DELETE now wrapped in a single transaction to reduce journal flushes
- SQLite `fetchTableMetadata` now caps row count scan at 100k rows to avoid full table scans on large tables
- SQLite `fetchIndexes` uses table-valued pragma functions in a single query instead of N+1 separate PRAGMA calls
- MySQL empty-result DESCRIBE fallback now only triggers for SELECT queries, avoiding redundant round-trips for non-SELECT statements
- Remove redundant `String(query)` copy in MariaDB query execution
- MySQL result fetching now uses `mysql_use_result` (streaming) instead of `mysql_store_result` (full buffering), so only the capped row count is held in memory instead of the entire server result set
- Instant pagination via approximate row count — MySQL/PostgreSQL tables now show "~N rows" immediately with data, then refine to exact count in background
- QueryTab uses value-based equality for SwiftUI diffing, eliminating unnecessary ForEach re-renders on tab array writes
- Cached static regex for `extractTableName`, `SQLiteDriver.stripLimitOffset`, and SQL function expressions to avoid per-call compilation
- Static NumberFormatter in status bar to avoid per-render locale resolution
- Batch `TableProTabSmart` field writes into single array store to avoid 14 CoW copies per query execution
- Tab persistence writes moved off main thread via `Task.detached`
- Single history entry per SQL import instead of per-statement recording
- WAL mode enabled for query history SQLite database
- Merged `fetchDatabaseMetadata` into single query for MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Health ping now uses dedicated metadata driver to avoid blocking user queries
- SSH tunnel setup extracted into shared helper to eliminate code duplication
- PostgreSQL DDL queries restructured with `async let` for cleaner dispatch (sequential on serial connection queue)
- Cancel query connection now uses 5-second connect timeout
- PostgreSQL connection parameters properly escaped for special characters
- SQLite `fetchAllColumns` overridden with single `sqlite_master` + `pragma_table_info` query
- Eliminated intermediate `[UInt8]` buffer in MySQL and PostgreSQL field extraction
- Column layout sync gated behind user-resize flag to skip O(n) loop on cursor moves
- Column width calculation uses monospace character arithmetic instead of per-row CoreText calls
- DataChangeManager maintains change index incrementally instead of full O(n) rebuild
- JSON export buffers writes per row instead of per field
- `SQLFormatterService` uses NSMutableString for keyword uppercasing and integer counter for placeholders
- SQLContextAnalyzer uses single alternation regex and single-pass state machine for string/comment detection
- `escapeJSONString` iterates UTF-8 bytes instead of grapheme clusters
- `AppSettingsStorage` caches JSONDecoder/JSONEncoder as stored properties
- `AppSettingsManager` stores validated settings in memory after didSet
- `FilterSettingsStorage` uses tracked key set instead of loading full plist
- Keychain saves use `SecItemAdd` + `SecItemUpdate` upsert pattern instead of delete + add
- Autocomplete `detectFunctionContext` uses index tracking instead of character-by-character string building

### Fixed

- Fix AND/OR filter logic mode ignored in query execution — preview showed correct OR logic but actual query always used AND
- Fix filter panel state (filters, visibility, quick search, logic mode) not preserved when switching between tabs
- Fix foreign key navigation filter being wiped when switching to a new tab (tab switch restore overwrote FK filter state)
- Fix pagination count appearing 200-300ms after data loads — approximate row count from database metadata now displays instantly with data, exact count refines silently in the background
- Fix foreign key navigation arrows and pagination count appearing with visible delay on initial table load — metadata now fetches on a dedicated parallel connection concurrent with the main query
- Fix LibPQ parameterized query using Swift `deallocate()` for `strdup`-allocated memory instead of `free()`
- FTS5 search input now sanitized to prevent parse errors from special characters like \*, OR, AND
- Fix SQL export corrupting newline/tab/backslash characters for PostgreSQL and SQLite (MySQL-style backslash escaping was incorrectly applied to all database types)
- Fix PostgreSQL SQL export failing to import when types/sequences already exist (`DROP IF EXISTS` now always emitted for dependent types and sequences)
- Fix PostgreSQL SQL export missing `CREATE TYPE` definitions for enum columns, causing import errors
- Fix PostgreSQL DDL tab not showing enum type definitions used by table columns
- Fix compilation error for PostgreSQL dependent sequences export (`fetchDependentSequences` missing from `DatabaseDriver` protocol)
- Fix PostgreSQL LIKE/NOT LIKE expressions missing `ESCAPE '\'` clause, causing wildcard escaping (`\%`, `\_`) to be treated as literal characters
- Fix SQLite regex filter silently degrading to LIKE substring match instead of being excluded from the WHERE clause

## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- Fix PostgreSQL SQL export failing to fetch DDL for tables (passed quoted identifier instead of raw table name to catalog queries)

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-23

### Changed

- Extract shared `performDirectTabSwitch` into `MainContentCoordinator` to eliminate duplicate tab-switch logic
- Welcome window now uses native macOS frosted glass translucency (NSVisualEffectView with behind-window blending)

### Fixed

- Auto-detect MySQL vs MariaDB server type from version string to use correct timeout variable (`max_execution_time` for MySQL, `max_statement_time` for MariaDB)
- Improved tab switching performance by caching row providers and change managers across SwiftUI render cycles
- Eliminated selection sync feedback loop causing redundant DataGridView updates during tab switch
- Enabled NSTableView row view recycling to reduce heap allocations during scrolling
- Reduced SwiftUI re-render cascades by batching @Published mutations during tab switch
- Improved DataGrid scrolling performance:
    - Row views now recycled via NSTableView's reuse pool instead of allocating new objects per scroll
    - Replaced O(n) String.count with O(1) NSString.length for large cell value truncation
    - Replaced expensive NSFontDescriptor.symbolicTraits checks with O(1) pointer equality on cached fonts
    - Added layerContentsRedrawPolicy and canDrawSubviewsIntoLayer to reduce compositing overhead
    - Cached NULL display string locally instead of per-cell singleton access
    - Cached AnyChangeManager to avoid per-render allocation with Combine subscriptions
    - Deferred accessibility label generation to when VoiceOver is active
    - Removed unnecessary async dispatch in focusedColumn, collapsed two reloadData calls into one

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-23

### Changed

- Replace generic SwiftUI colors with native macOS system colors (`Color(nsColor: .system*)` instead of `Color.red/green/blue/orange`) for proper dark mode, vibrancy, and accessibility adaptation
- Replace hardcoded opacity on semantic colors with `quaternaryLabelColor`/`tertiaryLabelColor`
- Use `shadowColor` instead of `Color.black` for shadows
- Replace iOS-style Capsule badges with RoundedRectangle

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-23

    - **I/O:** Throttled history cleanup (IO-1), async history storage migration (IO-2), consolidated onChange handlers (IO-3)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Inline AI suggestions (ghost text) in the SQL editor — auto-triggers on typing pause, Tab to accept, Escape to dismiss
- Schema-aware inline suggestions — AI now uses actual table/column names from the connected database (cached with 30s TTL, respects `includeSchema` and `maxSchemaTables` settings)
- AI feature highlight row on onboarding features page
- Added VoiceOver accessibility labels to custom controls: data grid (table view, column headers, cells), filter panel (logic toggle, presets, action buttons, filter row controls), toolbar buttons (connection switcher, database switcher, refresh, export, import, filter toggle, history toggle, inspector toggle), editor tab bar (tab items, close buttons, add tab button), and sidebar (table/view rows, search clear button)

### Changed

- Migrated notification observers in `MainContentCommandActions` from Combine publishers (`.publisher(for:).sink`) to async sequences (`for await` over `NotificationCenter.default.notifications(named:)`) — removes `AnyCancellable` storage in favor of `Task` handles with proper cancellation on deinit
- Migrated tab state persistence from UserDefaults to file-based storage in Application Support — prevents large JSON payloads from bloating the plist loaded at app launch, with automatic one-time migration of existing data
- Refactored menu and toolbar commands from NotificationCenter to `@FocusedObject` pattern — menu commands and toolbar buttons now call `MainContentCommandActions` methods directly instead of posting global notifications, with context-aware routing for structure view operations
- Redesigned connection form with tab-based layout (General / SSH Tunnel / SSL/TLS / Advanced), replacing the single-scroll layout
- Revamped connection form UI to use native macOS grouped form style (`Form`/`.formStyle(.grouped)`) with `LabeledContent` for automatic label-value alignment and `Section` headers — replacing the previous hand-rolled `VStack` layout with custom `FormField` component
- Removed unused `FormField` component and helper methods (`iconForType`, `colorForType`)
- SQLite connections now only show General and Advanced tabs (SSH/SSL hidden)
- Added async/await wrapper methods to `QueryHistoryStorage` — existing completion-handler API preserved for compatibility, new `async` overloads use `withCheckedContinuation` for modern Swift concurrency callers

### Fixed

- Fixed TOCTOU race condition in `SQLiteDriver` — replaced `nonisolated(unsafe)` + DispatchQueue pattern with a dedicated actor (`SQLiteConnectionActor`) that serializes all sqlite3 handle access, preventing concurrent task races on the connection state
- Consolidated multiple `.sheet(isPresented:)` modifiers in `MainContentView` into a single `.sheet(item:)` with an `ActiveSheet` enum — fixes SwiftUI anti-pattern where only the last `.sheet` modifier reliably activates
- Replaced blocking `Process.waitUntilExit()` calls in `SSHTunnelManager` with async `withCheckedContinuation`-based waiting, and replaced the fixed 1.5s sleep with active port probing — SSH tunnel setup no longer blocks the actor thread, keeping the UI responsive during connection
- Eliminated potential deadlocks in `MariaDBConnection` and `LibPQConnection` — replaced all `queue.sync` calls (in `disconnect`, `deinit`, `isConnected`, `serverVersion`) with lock-protected cached state and `queue.async` cleanup, preventing deadlocks when callbacks re-enter the connection queue
- SQL editor now respects the macOS accessibility text size preference (System Settings > Accessibility > Display > Text Size) — the user's chosen font size is scaled by the system's preferred text size factor, with live updates when the setting changes
- Fixed retain cycle in `UpdaterBridge` — `.assign(to:on:self)` retains self strongly; replaced with `.sink` using `[weak self]`
- Fixed leaked NotificationCenter observer in `SQLEditorCoordinator` — observer token is now stored and removed in `destroy()`
- Eliminated tab switching delay — replaced view teardown/recreation with `ZStack`+`ForEach` to keep NSViews alive, moved tab persistence I/O to background threads, skipped unnecessary change-tracking deep copies, and coalesced redundant inspector/sidebar updates during tab switch
- Reduced tab-switch CPU spikes from 40-60% to ~10-20% by eliminating redundant `reloadData()` calls: `configureForTable` no longer triggers a reload during tab switch (single controlled bump instead of 2-3), `onChange(of: resultColumns)` is suppressed while the switch is in progress, and `DataGridView.updateNSView` skips all heavy work when the data identity hasn't changed
- Table open now shows data instantly — split `executeQueryInternal` into two phases: rows display immediately after SELECT completes, metadata (columns, FKs, enums, row count) loads in the background without blocking the grid
- Eliminated 20-80ms overhead when clicking an already-open table in the sidebar — `openTableTab` short-circuits immediately, and `TableProTabSmart` no longer fires `@Published` when the selected tab hasn't changed
- Keychain `SecItemAdd` return values are now checked and logged — previously, failed writes (e.g. `errSecDuplicateItem`, `errSecInteractionNotAllowed`) were silently discarded, risking password loss
- Added `kSecAttrService` to all Keychain queries across `ConnectionStorage`, `LicenseStorage`, and `AIKeyStorage` — items now have a proper service identifier, preventing potential collisions with other apps
- Ensured proper cleanup for `@State` reference type tokens — tracked untracked `Task` instances in `ImportDialog` (file selection), `AIProviderEditorSheet` (model fetching, connection test), and added `onDisappear` cancellation to prevent leaked work after view dismissal
- Replaced `.onAppear` with `.task` for I/O operations in `ConnectionTagEditor` — uses SwiftUI-idiomatic lifecycle-tied loading instead of `onAppear` which can re-fire on navigation

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- AI chat panel — native macOS inspector styling: removed iOS-style chat bubbles, flattened message layout with role headers and compact spacing, reduced heading sizes for narrow sidebar, inline typing indicator without pill background
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** migrated 5 NSPopover controllers (Enum, Set, TypePicker, JSONEditor, ForeignKey) to SwiftUI content views with a shared `PopoverPresenter` utility — eliminates manual `NSEvent` monitors, `NSPopoverDelegate`, and singleton patterns
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced `KeyEventHandler` NSViewRepresentable with native `.onKeyPress()` modifiers (macOS 14+) in DatabaseSwitcherSheet and WelcomeWindowView
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced AppKit history panel (5 files: `HistoryPanelController`, `HistoryListViewController`, `QueryPreviewViewController`, `HistoryTableView`, `HistoryRowView`) with single pure SwiftUI `HistoryPanelView` using `HSplitView`, `List` with selection, context menus, and swipe-to-delete
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced `ExportTableOutlineView` (NSOutlineView, 757 lines across 2 files) with SwiftUI `ExportTableTreeView` using `List`, `DisclosureGroup`, and tristate checkboxes (~146 lines)
- **Design tokens:** replaced hardcoded `Color.secondary.opacity(0.6)` with system `Color(nsColor: .tertiaryLabelColor)` in `DesignConstants` and `ToolbarDesignTokens` for proper semantic color

### Added

- AI chat panel shows "Set Up AI Provider" empty state when no AI provider is configured, with a button to open Settings
- AI chat panel — right-side panel for AI-assisted SQL queries with multi-provider support (Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, custom endpoints)
- AI provider settings — configure multiple AI providers in Settings > AI with API key management (Keychain), endpoint configuration, model selection, and connection testing
- AI feature routing — map AI features (Chat, Explain Query, Fix Error, Inline Suggestions) to specific providers and models
- AI schema context — automatically includes database schema, current query, and query results in AI conversations for context-aware assistance
- AI chat code blocks — SQL code blocks in AI responses include Copy and Insert to Editor buttons
- AI chat markdown rendering — replaced custom per-line AttributedString parsing with MarkdownUI library for full CommonMark + GitHub Flavored Markdown support (proper lists, tables, blockquotes, headers, strikethrough)
- Per-connection AI policy — control AI access per connection (Always Allow, Ask Each Time, Never) in the connection form
- Toggle AI Chat keyboard shortcut (`⌘⇧L`) and toolbar button
- Tab reuse setting — opt-in option in Settings > Tabs to reuse clean table tabs when clicking a new table in the sidebar (off by default)
- Structure view: full undo/redo support (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z) for all column, index, and foreign key operations
- Structure view: database-specific type picker popover for the Type column — searchable, grouped by category (Numeric, String, Date & Time, Binary, Other), supports freeform input for parametric types like `VARCHAR(255)`
- Structure view: YES/NO dropdown menu for Nullable, Auto Inc, and Unique columns (replaces freeform text input)
- Structure view: "Don't show again" toggle in SQL preview sheet now correctly skips the review step on future saves
- SQL autocomplete: new clause types — RETURNING, UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT, OVER/PARTITION BY, USING, DROP/CREATE INDEX/VIEW
- SQL autocomplete: smart clause transition suggestions (e.g., WHERE after FROM, HAVING after GROUP BY, LIMIT after ORDER BY)
- SQL autocomplete: qualified column suggestions (`table.column`) in JOIN ON clauses and `table.*` in SELECT

### Changed

- **Layout architecture:** replaced `SplitViewMinWidthEnforcer` NSViewRepresentable hack with proper AppDelegate-based inspector split view configuration — eliminates KVO observation, 300ms sleep, and recursive view tree traversal
- **Inspector data flow:** replaced manual snapshot syncing (`syncRightPanelSnapshotData()` + 5 `onChange` handlers) with `InspectorContext` value type passed directly through the view hierarchy via `@Binding`
- **Right panel state:** `RightPanelState` no longer holds snapshot copies of coordinator data or a weak coordinator reference — it now only manages panel visibility, tab state, and owned objects
- **AI chat panel:** receives `currentQuery: String?` parameter instead of a `MainContentCoordinator` reference — better separation of concerns
- **Sidebar save:** replaced `.saveSidebarChanges` notification with direct closure (`RightPanelState.onSave`) set by the notification handler
- Structure tab grid columns now auto-size to fit content on data load
- Structure view column headers and status messages are now localized
- SQL autocomplete: 50ms debounce for completion triggers to reduce unnecessary work
- SQL autocomplete: fuzzy matching rewritten for O(1) character access performance

### Fixed

- **Structure view:** undo/redo (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z) now works for all schema editing operations — previously non-functional
- **Structure view:** undo-delete no longer duplicates existing rows in the grid
- **Structure view:** deleting a new (unsaved) item then undoing correctly re-adds it
- **Structure view:** save button now disabled when validation errors exist (empty column names/types)
- **Structure view:** validation now rejects indexes and foreign keys referencing columns pending deletion
- **Structure view:** multi-column foreign keys are correctly preserved instead of being truncated to single-column
- **Structure view:** renaming a MySQL/MariaDB column now uses `CHANGE COLUMN` instead of `MODIFY COLUMN` (which cannot rename)
- **Structure view:** eliminated redundant `discardChanges()` and `loadSchemaForEditing()` calls on save and initial load
- **PostgreSQL:** DDL tab now includes PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and FOREIGN KEY constraints plus standalone indexes
- **PostgreSQL:** primary key columns are now correctly detected and displayed in the structure grid
- **Security:** escape table and database names in all driver schema queries to prevent SQL injection from names containing special characters
- **SQL editor:** undo/redo (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z) now works correctly (was blocked by responder chain selector mismatch)
- **SQL autocomplete:** clause detection now works correctly inside subqueries
- **SQL autocomplete:** block comment detection no longer treats `--` inside `/* */` as a line comment
- **SQL autocomplete:** database-specific type keywords (e.g., PostgreSQL `JSONB`, MySQL `ENUM`) now appear in suggestions
- **SQL autocomplete:** schema suggestions no longer disappear after CREATE TABLE
- **SQL autocomplete:** function completion now inserts `COUNT()` with cursor between parentheses instead of `COUNT(`
- **SQL autocomplete:** RETURNING suggestions now work after INSERT INTO and after closed `VALUES (...)` parentheses
- **SQL autocomplete:** CREATE INDEX ON suggests columns from the referenced table instead of table names
- **SQL autocomplete:** transition keywords (WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY) no longer buried under columns at clause boundaries
- **SQL autocomplete:** schema-qualified names (e.g., `schema.table.column`) handled correctly
- **Data grid:** column order no longer flashes/swaps when sorting (stable identifiers for layout persistence)
- **Data grid:** "Copy Column Name" and "Filter with column" context menu actions no longer copy sort indicators (e.g., "name 1▲")
- **SQL generation:** ALTER TABLE, DDL, and SQL Preview statements now consistently end with a semicolon
- **AI chat:** "Ask Each Time" connection policy now shows a confirmation dialog before sending data to AI — previously silently fell through to "Always Allow"

### Removed

- Deleted unused `StructureTableCoordinator.swift` (~275 lines of dead code)
- Deleted 5 dead NSToolbar files (`ToolbarController`, `ToolbarWindowConfigurator`, `ToolbarItemFactory`, `ToolbarItemIdentifier`, `ToolbarHostingViews`) — never referenced by active code
